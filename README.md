# SVL Rover App

A simple app designed to control the Mars Rover exhibit in SVL from a tablet.  In general, this app can be used to control the pan and zoom of WWT from a tablet. 

Documentation can be found on this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/ageller/SVL_RoverApp/wiki).


NOTE: this repo is now deprecated.  I combined this with the [SVL Database Navigator app](https://github.com/ageller/SVL_db_nav), and all future updates will happen there.
